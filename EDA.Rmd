## consider transform response variable
```{r}

law_df %>% 
    pull(sal94) %>%
    qqnorm()

law_df <- 
    law_df %>% 
    mutate(sal94 = log(sal94),
           sal95 = log(sal94),
           percent = (sal95 - sal94)/sal94)
law_df %>%

# 1. Confounders 
## 1.1 table1(covariates and outcome by gender)
```{r}
# descriptive statistics for variables of interest
control_table <- tableby.control(
        total = T,
        test = T,
        numeric.stats = c("meansd","medianq1q3","range"),
        stats.labels = list(meansd = "Mean (SD)",
                            medianq1q3 = "Median (Q1, Q3)",
                            range = "Min - Max"),
        digits = 2
        ) 
# cat.stats = "countrowpct" 

law_df %>% 
        tableby(gender ~ .,
                data = .,
                control = control_table) %>% 
        summary(text = TRUE) %>% 
        kableExtra::kable(caption = "Characcteristics of college faculty") 
```

The `clin` and `cert` has a p-value >0.05 (but < 0.20), suggesting that the composition of  `clin` and `cert` are not very different in female and male.
But still, we will check their impact on coefficient of female later.

# 1.2 exploratory visualization (relationship between salary and exposure/covariate)
## 1.2.1 categorical
```{r}
map(law_df[,c(1:4,7)], 
    ~ggplot(aes(y = sal94,x = .x, fill = gender),data = law_df) + geom_boxplot()) %>% 
    cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = .,ncol = 2,labels = colnames(law_df[,c(1:4,7)]))
```

I want yo draw your attention to the `rank` plot. 
Seems that for male, salary doesn't change that much from assistant to full professor. But for female, it changes a lot.   

## 1.2.2 continuous 
```{r}
map(law_df[,5:6], 
    ~ggplot(aes(y = sal94,x = .x, color = gender),data = law_df) + 
            geom_point() + 
            geom_smooth(method = "lm",se = F)) %>%
    cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = .,ncol = 1,labels = colnames(law_df[,5:6]))
```

We see a non-parallel(slightly) slope of `exper`, so we may consider interaction term in our model. 

## 1.3 Adjusted vs crude coefficients of female.
```{r}
crude <- 
    lm(sal94 ~ gender, data = law_df) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    filter(term == "genderFemale") %>% 
    pull(estimate)

adj <-
    law_df %>% 
    select(dept,clin,cert,prate,exper,rank) %>% 
    map(~lm(sal94 ~ gender + .x, data = law_df) %>% broom::tidy()) %>% 
    map_dbl(~filter(.x,term == "genderFemale") %>% pull(estimate)) 

change <- round(100*(crude - adj)/crude,digits = 2)
change
```

Rule of thumb, these covariate can all be confounders. 

# 2. Interaction:only consider two-way for now
First, I think it's ok(or not wrong) not to include interaction in our model. 
But's it's interesting to explore the interaction

# 3.Multiple linear regression model
## 3.1 without any interaction
```{r}
full <- lm(sal94 ~ gender + dept + clin + cert + prate + exper + rank, data = law_df) 
summary(full)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(full)
HH::vif(full)
```

Ah. May be... there is no "obvious" discrimination. (coz these confouders maybe actually mediators.)

## stepwise(not sure if necessary) 
```{r}
lower_gender <- lm(sal94 ~ gender, data = law_df) 
step(full,scope = list(lower = lower_gender))
model_stepwise <- lm(formula = sal94 ~ gender + dept + clin + cert + exper + rank, data = law_df) 
```

## 3.2  with some interaction
```{r}
model_stepwise <- lm(sal94 ~ gender + dept + clin + cert + exper + rank, data = law_df) 

inter1 <- lm(sal94 ~ gender + gender*dept + gender*clin + gender*cert  +  gender*exper + gender*exper + gender*rank,data = law_df) 

anova(model_stepwise,inter1)

lm(sal94 ~ gender + dept + clin + cert  + gender*exper + gender*rank, data = law_df) %>% summary()
```
